# ClipFix

## What is it?

This package tries to overcome some of the issues with copying code examples from
various sources *such as pdf files where there are likely to be line numbers*,
the Python REPL, *where prompts confuse things*, or iPython where numbered prompts
are an issue.

## Installation

You can install with:

```
   pip install clipfix
```
